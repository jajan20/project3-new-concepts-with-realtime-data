## Stakeholders
This project had different stakeholders, for this project we could specify the stakeholder(s) we wanted to target. In my case the customers of café "de Ceuvel".

## Design Challenge
How can we teach customers of café "de Ceuvel" about sustainability in a fun and interesting way?

## Concept
Before I could tackle the challenge I needed to figure out what was out there, with what information I could work with and how I could make this interesting for my stakeholder.

#### How?
The specifics are that de Ceuvel uses a lot of sustainable systems, one of them is their aquaponics system. In short, loads of fish in a tank create water filled with ammonia which is filtered by bacteria group A (NITROSOMAS) and they create NITRITE. NITRITE is filtered by bacteria group B (nitrospira) who create NITRATE. This combined with the compost created in the vermicomposting process is food for the plants in the greenhouse. The water containing is filtered by the plants and the clean water is pumped back to the fish.

Café de Ceuvel uses the plants grown in their greenhouse as ingredients.

#### Idea
I think there is something here, right now all the data collected by de ceuvel is just a bunch of data. Very valuable data! but, for the customers not really relevant. How can I change this?

This is where I think my concept is really strong. Let's say you're at the restaurant. You order something off the menu and then you have to wait till your food is ready. My idea is as follows:

You order your food, once you take out your smartphone and add your table number you can see all the orders that are being made. That's not all.

Specifics on an order being made:

#### Gas
- How much gas is needed to prepare your meal?
    - How does the ceuvel get their gas?
    - Can I contribute to their gas supply? (waste)
    - Interesting facts

#### Electricity
- How much electricity is used?
    - Where does the electricity come from?
    - Do they store power in batteries?

#### Herbs and Vegetables
- What ingredients taken from the greenhouse are used in your order?
    - When did the season start?
    - How long did it take to grow?
    - What is in my order?

## Realtime
Since a lot of the data is processed real-time I can incorporate this into my concept. When the meal is being prepared I can show the consumption of gas and electricity on the screen. This gives a feeling of awareness, commitment. Customers can see exactly what is needed for their order.

## High fidelity design
This is the way I want to go, adding pictures of the dishes and other visual stimuli. By keeping the data simple and easy to process the customer isn't overwhelmed by a lot of numbers and it's easier to compare the results.
